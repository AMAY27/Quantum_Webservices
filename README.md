# Quantum Web Services Research 
## Introduction
This research on Quantum Web Services was conducted under the supervision of the Distributed and Self-Organizing Computer Systems Professorship at Chemnitz University of Technology in Chemnitz, Germany.

## Background
Web services are an essential part of the modern internet. They allow different software applications to communicate with each other and exchange data. With the increasing demand for faster and more efficient communication, web services need to keep up with the latest technological advancements.

Quantum computing is a new computing paradigm that promises to revolutionize the way we process information. Quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, instead of classical bits to perform computations. This allows them to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.

## Research
Our research compares the power and cost of quantum computing to classical computers. We analyze the differences in infrastructure and system implementation architecture between the two types of computations. Additionally, we examine which areas of web development can benefit from quantum computing and which areas may be affected by future threats to existing security protocols.

## Conclusion
Quantum computing is a promising technology that can revolutionize the field of web services. The research on Quantum Web Services has shown that quantum computing can significantly improve the performance of web services. As quantum computing continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see more applications of this technology in the field of web services.
