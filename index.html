        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p><i>Edited by Amirali Shaban Khamseh</i></p>
        <h3> 1.1. introduction to quantum computing </h3>
        <p>
            To gain a better understanding of quantum computers, let's examine their differences compared to classical
            computers. Classical computers operate using bits, which can exist in either a state of one or zero. In
            contrast, quantum computers make use of quantum bits, or Qubits for short. Qubits can exist in superposition
            states, representing a linear combination of zero and one. These states are entangled with each other,
            allowing them to influence each other's behavior regardless of the distance between them.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we attempt to determine the value of each state, the states collapse, providing us with a single value.
            This process is known as measurement in quantum computing. To control the benefits of Qubits, we must
            perform our computations during the pre-measurement phase. Additionally, it is possible to manipulate the
            states in this phase by using quantum gates. Quantum gates can be thought of as logical gates that alter the
            values of the states.
        </p>
        <p>By arranging these gates in a series, we can construct a quantum circuit. Depending on our specific problem,
            we may require a certain number or set of input values. Once we apply the desired logic, we can obtain the
            output(s) from the circuit we have created. A quantum computer is essential to provide the computational
            power necessary for Qubits within this circuit.
        </p>
        <h3> 1.2. How Qubit can have a more powerful computation ? </h3>
        <p>After understanding what a Qubit is and the fundamental differences between qubits and bits, we can explore
            These differences help us become better at computing.
            Considering a system with N
            qubits, it can simultaneously operate on all possible permutations of 2 to the power of N.
            This is very different from classical computers, which can only use one state from the permutations. For
            instance,
            a system equipped with 250 qubits can handle more states than there are atoms in the entire universe.
            <a href="#r1">[1]</a>

            Even though it seems like a huge number, we have already gone beyond it. Presently, Quantum computers can use more than 430 qubits for calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
            When discussing the substantial computational power, concerns about potential threats to security protocols
            arise. Can the current power pose a risk to our existing security protocols? Let's consider the widely used
            RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) protocol as an example. Cracking RSA would require a minimum of one million
            qubits. Thus, the answer to this question is no; we are not currently facing a threat. However, an interesting prediction says that by 2048, We could potentially break this type of encryption in just 24 hours. <a href="#r2">[2]</a>

        <h3> 2.1. Quantum global investment</h3>
        <p>
            Last year, approximately $30 billion was invested globally in the field of quantum technology. This
            substantial investment highlights the immense size of this field and its potential for significant growth in
            the coming years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Among all nations, China stands out with the highest contribution, accounting for half of the total
            investment. Following China, European countries collectively hold the second position. Within Europe,
            Germany has made the most significant contribution compared to other European nations. Additionally, the
            European Commission has allocated one billion dollars to support a group of researchers known as the EU
            Quantum Flagships. This funding aims to facilitate the commercialization of quantum services within Europe.
        </p>
        <h3> 2.2. Companies and start-ups in the area of Quantum Web services</h3>
        <p>
            Using the power of quantum computing through the classical computer interface is no longer just a wish; it
            has become a reality, thanks to companies like Amazon, IBM, Google, and D-wave. These companies offer
            quantum services through the cloud, employing a cost-per-usage model.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, the Quantum program can be deployed via this interface onto the Quantum hardware, and the cost
            will be
            determined based on the hardware's processing power. The results of running this program through the same
            interface will then be provided to the user.

        <h2>6 . Quantum usecases for web</h2>
        <p><i>Edited by Amirali Shaban Khamseh</i></p>
        <h3>6.1. Areas we may not need the Quantum power on web</h3>

        <p>
            So far, we have discussed how powerful quantum computing is. However, it's important to note that we
            may not require this level of computational power for all the web services we use. For instance, sending and
            receiving emails do not necessitate quantum power. The current architecture for this specific task is
            well-established, and it generally doesn't demand significant computing power. Nevertheless, in the future,
            quantum power may be used to enhance the security of communication channels.
        </p>
       
        <p>
            Additionally, storing data on a quantum computer is not a practical task. Their memory only lasts for a
            couple of microseconds, whereas current database management systems are designed to efficiently handle data
            storage. However, we can still use the power of quantum computing for data search in databases. By
            utilizing quantum algorithms like Grover's algorithm, we can search for data in a quadratic time complexity,
            providing a potential advantage compared to the current search algorithms.
        </p>
        <h3>6.2. Areas we will need the Quantum Power</h3>
        <p>Having quantum computational power can be advantageous in various areas of the web, such as cryptography. As
            mentioned earlier, the natural uncertainty of qubit values can be used as a benefit. This can allow us to
            create unhackable private keys, a method commonly referred to as quantum-safe cryptography.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, artificial intelligence and language models can benefit from this power. Language models
            require the analysis of big data models and algorithms that run on top of these datasets to learn and gather
            valuable information. However, this task can be highly resource-intensive and consume significant
            computational power. Quantum power, on the other hand, enables us to analyze huge datasets all at once and
            run complex algorithms in parallel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, quantum power proves to be useful when dealing with optimization problems. These types of
            problems are currently a challenge for classical computers due to their complex nature and continuous
            variables in the optimization equations. However, with the help of quantum computing, we can handle a vast
            set of inputs and reduce them to those with a higher probability of desired outcomes. After forming this
            subgroup, we can then hand them over to classical computers to solve them traditionally. This hybrid
            approach allows us to benefit from the strengths of each computing system and effectively solve these problems.

        <h2>9.Architecture of Quantum Web services API and practical problems </h2>
        <p><i>Edited by Amirali Shaban Khamseh</i></p>
        <h3>9.1. API gateway</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="Figure4.PNG" alt="Quantum API gateway" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 4</strong>: Quantum API gateway <a href="#r4">[4]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The process of using this API involves seven steps. Initially, clients need to design the quantum circuit,
            selecting the relevant quantum gates based on the specific set of inputs. Along with the circuit, an
            optimization factor, which determines the best hardware for running the program, is sent to the API's
            recommender.</p>
        <p>The recommender analyzes the circuit and optimization factor to suggest the most suitable quantum hardware.
            It also checks the availability of the recommended hardware. Once the status of the quantum hardware is
            determined, all the data is forwarded to the API service manager.</p>
        <p>Based on the inputs and the selected hardware, the API service manager requests the deployment requirements
            from the specific quantum hardware. If all the requirements are met, the circuit is deployed on top of the
            hardware.</p>
        <p>After the calculation process is completed, the result is sent back to the user who initiated the process by
            calling the API.</p>
        <h3>9.2. Traditional API versus API gateway</h3>
        <p>
            In the current systems we use, we deploy our system once on a server and make multiple calls to retrieve
            data with the applied logic through the provided API interfaces. However, quantum computing operates
            differently. In the world of quantum computing, we cannot deploy the system once and make multiple calls in
            the same way. To deploy a program, we need to invoke a specific API provided by the Quantum hardware
            provider through their dedicated interface. This API gateway is responsible for deploying the entire system
            on the quantum hardware upon invocation and returning the execution results through the same interface to
            the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            When considering resource-intensive applications that require frequent invocation, the cost can be
            significant. Each API invocation for deployment consumes resources, and the accumulated usage is calculated
            as the final cost for the user. Furthermore, when invoking the API, it checks the input preferences for
            hardware and the availability of the requested hardware. If the desired hardware is not available, we may
            need to use another hardware option that is not optimized for our specific task. Consequently, we may not
            achieve the expected results due to hardware changes.
        </p>
        <p>

            Moreover, while traditional APIs operate based on established standards and protocols, the Quantum API
            gateway protocols have not yet been widely established, leading to a lack of standardized protocols in the
            quantum computing domain.
