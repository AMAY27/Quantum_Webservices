        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p><i>Edited by Amirali Shaban Khamseh</i></p>
        <h3> 1.1. introduction to quantum computing </h3>
        <p>
            To gain a better understanding of quantum computers, let's examine their differences compared to classical
            computers.Classical computers operate using bits, which can exist in either a state of one or zero. In
            contrast, quantum computers make use of quantum bits, or Qubits for short. Qubits can exist in superposition
            states, representing a linear combination of zero and one.These states are entangled with each other,
            allowing them to influence each other's behavior regardless of the distance between them. <a href="#r1">[1]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            When we attempt to determine the value of each state, the states collapse, providing us with a single value.
            This process is known as measurement in quantum computing. To control the benefits of Qubits, we must
            perform our computations during the pre-measurement phase. Additionally, it is possible to manipulate the
            states in this phase by using quantum gates. Quantum gates can be thought of as logical gates that alter the
            values of the states.<a href="#r2">[2]</a>
        </p>
        <p>By arranging these gates in a series, we can construct a quantum circuit. Depending on our specific problem,
            we may require a certain number or set of input values. Once we apply the desired logic, we can obtain the
            output(s) from the circuit we have created. A quantum computer is essential to provide the computational
            power necessary for Qubits within this circuit.<a href="#r2">[2]</a>
        </p>
        <h3> 1.2. How Qubits can have a more powerful computation ? </h3>
        <p>After understanding what a Qubit is and the fundamental differences between qubits and bits, we can explore
            These differences help us become better at computing.
            Considering a system with N
            qubits, it can simultaneously operate on all possible permutations of 2 to the power of N.
            This is very different from classical computers, which can only use one state from the permutations. For
            instance,
            a system equipped with 250 qubits can handle more states than there are atoms in the entire universe.
            <a href="#r1">[1]</a>

            Even though it seems like a huge number, we have already gone beyond it. Presently, Quantum computers can
            use more than 430 qubits for calculations. <a href="#r8">[8]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            When discussing the substantial computational power, concerns about potential threats to security protocols
            arise. Can the current power pose a risk to our existing security protocols? Let's consider the widely used
            RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) protocol as an example. Cracking RSA would require a minimum of one million
            qubits. Thus, the answer to this question is no; we are not currently facing a threat. However, an
            interesting prediction says that by 2048, We could potentially break this type of encryption in just 24
            hours. <a href="#r3">[3]</a>

        <p><i>Edited by Amirali Shaban Khamseh</i></p>
        <h3> 2.1. Quantum global investment</h3>
        <p>
            Last year, approximately $30 billion was invested globally in the field of quantum technology. This
            substantial investment highlights the immense size of this field and its potential for significant growth in
            the coming years. <a href="#r2">[2]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Among all nations, China stands out with the highest contribution, accounting for half of the total
            investment. Following China, European countries collectively hold the second position. Within Europe,
            Germany has made the most significant contribution compared to other European nations. Additionally, the
            European Commission has allocated one billion dollars to support a group of researchers known as the EU
            Quantum Flagships. This funding aims to facilitate the commercialization of quantum services within Europe.<a href="#r2">[2]</a>
        </p>
        <h3> 2.2. Companies and start-ups in the area of Quantum Web services</h3>
        <p>
            Using the power of quantum computing through the classical computer interface is no longer just a wish; it
            has become a reality, thanks to companies like Amazon, IBM, Google, and D-wave. These companies offer
            quantum services through the cloud, employing a cost-per-usage model.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, the Quantum program can be deployed via this interface onto the Quantum hardware, and the cost
            will be
            determined based on the hardware's processing power. The results of running this program through the same
            interface will then be provided to the user.

        <h3>3.1. Common grounds from three distinguished fields</h3>
        <p>
            Quantum Software Engineering combines software engineering with three different domains based on their
            paradigms. This combination could be seen as a mismatch that leverages the capabilities of different fields
            to evolve classical software engineering. Software engineering is an evolving field that deals with complex
            real-world problems and provides software-based solutions to these problems. On the other hand, we have
            areas such as
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Mathematics:</b> one of the oldest fields of research, which is developed over centuries to support the
            study of the universe and science. The basic principle of mathematics is algorithms and formulations
            developed over decades to solve complex problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Computation:</b> a field based on facts and rules which are derived from mathematics and used to perform
            operations that require results from calculations using mathematical paradigms.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Quantum Physics:</b> the study of the fundamental laws that govern nature and the universe is the basic
            principle of physics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Quantum software engineering is a process for developing software for complex quantum algorithms that can be
            executed on quantum computers. This software can then be used to perform complex tasks which are not in the
            scope of classical computing capabilities.

        <h2>4. Researches in Quantum Web Services</h2>
        <p><i>Edited by Amay Rajvaidya</i></p>
        <p>
            At present, there are plenty of organisations which are researching on the implementation of architecture for
            Quantum web services.
            Quantum network and service architecture can be visualized by combining various aspects of classical web
            services such as Software as a Service(SaaS), communication and networking. Quantum web services is being
            conducted in relation with various aspects of classical services.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>4.1. Quantum Computing as a Service</h3>
        The concept of Quantum computing as a Service is to provide quantum algorithms and quantum computing capabilities as
        a classical service so that anyone can access the quantum system from anywhere in the world without having their own
        physical quantum system. Quantum web services involve a network of quantum computers and communication channels that
        provide remote access to quantum algorithms and capabilities via the internet.
        Currently there are many cloud providers like Amazon Bracket, Dwave, etc which are providing access to their quantum
        system via internet. The research department in these cloud providers are working on more efficient ways to access
        and perform quantum services on classical systems. Code platforms are being developed to create interfaces for
        communicating with quantum services.
        </p>
        <p>
    
        <h3>4.2. Quantum-based encryption</h3>
        Unlike the classical web services architecture that relies on security protocols for information transmission over
        the network, quantum services utilize Quantum-based encryption to securely transmit qubits over the quantum network.
        Quantum-based encryption relies on a technique of quantum cryptography known as Quantum Key Distribution. Currently,
        studies are being conducted in the field of post-quantum cryptography to investigate the impact and security risks
        of real-world quantum network implementation and to develop security protocols for communication in a quantum
        network.
        </p>
        <p>
    
        <h3>4.3. Quantum Hardware and Computing</h3>
    
        There is much ongoing research focused on improving the scalability, coherence, and stability of quantum systems.
        This research is being used to develop quantum algorithms for various applications. Progress in this area is a very
        important aspect for the practical implementation of the architecture of quantum web services that provide enhanced
        computation capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
    
        <h3>4.3. Quantum communication and networking</h3>
        Researchers are working on long distance transmission of information in the form of quantum bits over various
        communication channels. Since quantum bits require an optimal temperature to be maintained so that they hold their
        state and no loss of information occurs, the transmission of these qubits over network channels is very complex.
        Quantum networking aims to interconnect multiple quantum systems of different configurations so that they can
        process multiple quantum functions without having an interface for these functions stored in their systems.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>4.4. Quantum software and programming</h3>
    
        as the implementation of quantum services increases, a need for quantum programming languages and software
        development tools emerges. Basic types of quantum computing languages include the quantum instruction set and the
        quantum development kit.

            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Quantum instruction set:</b> "These are used to turn complex algorithms into physical instructions
                    that can be performed on quantum processors and vary depending on the qubit modality of the quantum
                    architecture (superconducting/silicon-based/trapped ions etc) of the hardware platform" <a

            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Quantum development kits:</b> "Quantum software development kits (SDKs) offer various tools to design
                    and exploit quantum programs, while also providing the user with the ability to simulate the quantum
                    programs or prepare them to be run using cloud-based quantum devices. The Current SDKs with access to
                    quantum processors and/or Quantum Development Kits available are Ocean, Qiskit, ProjectQ, Forest,
                    Strawberry Fields, PennyLane, and Cirq" <a href="#r5">[5]</a>.

        <h2>5. Challenges for quantum web services</h2>
        <p><i>Edited by Amay Rajvaidya</i></p>
        <p>
        <h3>5.1. Quantum hardware</h3> scalability and coherence: successful implementation of quantum web services
        depends mainly on the availability of scalable and reliable quantum systems. Currently, many quantum systems are
        still in the development phase, so there are still limitations in qubit coherence and scalability.
        "Quantum coherence is a desired property for a qubit. The duration of the qubit coherence is used to make
        quality comparisons between qubits. Coherence tells us something about how long a qubit retains its information,
        and thus dictates some sort of lifetime"<a href="#r6">[6]</a>.
        To ensure proper flow and processing of qubits from different configurations, quantum systems must be compatible
        and scalable with classical computing.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>5.2. Lack of standards and protocols</h3> classical web services have an REST API architecture that includes
        protocols such as HTTP, IP, TCP, and other well-known protocols to establish secure and reliable communication.
        However, in the case of quantum web services, there is no defined protocol for secure transmission of qubits.
        Currently, post-quantum cryptography (developments in Quantum Key Distribution) is in the process of being
        implemented as a protocol for quantum networks. However, it is currently a challenge to practically implement a
        channel for qubits between quantum systems.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>5.3. Decoupling</h3> another important aspect of the classical service architecture is decoupling, which
        allows developers to create stubs from various code generation tools for defining services in different
        programming languages. This makes the development more agile and flexible for developers. However, for quantum
        web services, there is a lack of specifications and tools that can generate a structure for API calls.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>5.4. Complex architecture for web services</h3> On one side we have software development, a fast growing
        field with new technologies and tools that improve the development process every day, and on the other side we
        have quantum service architecture that requires developers to define circuits and interfaces on their end just
        to access a specific quantum system and algorithm. In comparison, quantum service development is much more
        complex for developers. As the demand for quantum algorithms will increase in the future, SDKs and tools will
        evolve to simplify access to quantum capabilities.

        <h2>6.Quantum usecases for web</h2>
        <p><i>Edited by Amirali Shaban Khamseh</i></p>
        <h3>6.1. Areas we may not need the Quantum power on web <a href="#r9">[9]</a> </h3> 

        <p>
            So far, we have discussed how powerful quantum computing is. However, it's important to note that we
            may not require this level of computational power for all the web services we use. For instance, sending and
            receiving emails do not necessitate quantum power. The current architecture for this specific task is
            well-established, and it generally doesn't demand significant computing power. Nevertheless, in the future,
            quantum power may be used to enhance the security of communication channels. </a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, storing data on a quantum computer is not a practical task. Their memory only lasts for a
            couple of microseconds, whereas current database management systems are designed to efficiently handle data
            storage. However, we can still use the power of quantum computing for data search in databases. By
            utilizing quantum algorithms like Grover's algorithm, we can search for data in a quadratic time complexity,
            providing a potential advantage compared to the current search algorithms.
        </p>
        <h3>6.2. Areas we will need the Quantum Power <a href="#r9">[9]</a> </h3> 
        <p>Having quantum computational power can be advantageous in various areas of the web, such as cryptography. As
            mentioned earlier, the natural uncertainty of qubit values can be used as a benefit. This can allow us to
            create unhackable private keys, a method commonly referred to as quantum-safe cryptography.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, artificial intelligence and language models can benefit from this power. Language models
            require the analysis of big data models and algorithms that run on top of these datasets to learn and gather
            valuable information. However, this task can be highly resource-intensive and consume significant
            computational power. Quantum power, on the other hand, enables us to analyze huge datasets all at once and
            run complex algorithms in parallel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, quantum power proves to be useful when dealing with optimization problems. These types of
            problems are currently a challenge for classical computers due to their complex nature and continuous
            variables in the optimization equations. However, with the help of quantum computing, we can handle a vast
            set of inputs and reduce them to those with a higher probability of desired outcomes. After forming this
            subgroup, we can then hand them over to classical computers to solve them traditionally. This hybrid
            approach allows us to benefit from the strengths of each computing system and effectively solve these
            problems.

        <h2>7.Current capabilities of quantum computers </h2>
        <p><i>Edited by Amay Rajvaidya</i></p>
        <p>
        <h3>7.1. Qubits</h3> Recent developments in quantum systems have led IBM to develop the most powerful quantum
        system called Osprey with a processing capacity of 433 qubits. IBM is also working on merging four quantum
        systems and developing a transmission channel between the systems to achieve a processing capacity of about 1000
        qubits.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>7.2. Quantum simulations</h3> Quantum computers are used to simulate various quantum systems on classical
        computers. Although these simulations are limited to small-case systems due to the current hardware constraints,
        they have performed promising use cases such as modelling chemical reactions and material properties, which is a
        very important aspect of drug discovery and material science. These simulations can also help in optimization
        techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>7.3. Quantum algorithms</h3> The main purpose of quantum computers is to execute quantum algorithms more
        efficiently than classical computers for certain tasks. For example: the Shor’s algorithm, which can factorise
        large prime numbers, and it has a potential use case of cracking the RSA-based encryption algorithm used
        worldwide. While classical computers take years to crack RSA encryption, quantum systems can achieve that in a
        matter of hours. However, to achieve this performance, quantum computers would need to have a processing
        capacity of one million qubits. Another example of a quantum algorithm is the Grover’s algorithm, which has a
        quadratic speedup compared to classical systems when searching for unsorted datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>7.4. Quantum cryptography </h3>quantum cryptography, also known as the unhackable cryptography system, has
        been supported by quantum systems for years to improve encryption. The Quantum key distribution (QKD) is based
        on quantum mechanics principles that enable secure communication channels.
        "A security solution is as secure as its weakest link. In network encryption, the current weakest link with
        respect to the quantum computer threat is the secret key distribution based on public key cryptography. As its
        name says, QKD is used to distribute encryption keys, whose security is based on quantum physics and is thus
        guaranteed for the long-term<a href="#r7">[7]</a>. "
        In the future advances of quantum services, quantum key distribution is the most sought-after function of
        quantum systems.

        <h2>8.Unfeasible Features of quantum web services</h2>
        <p><i>Editeb by Amay Rajvaidya</i></p>
        <p>
        <h3>8.1. User controls and synchronization</h3> One of the major drawbacks of quantum web services is user
        control over the services requested by quantum systems. In classical web services, the user can control the
        behavior of requests and responses, while quantum systems can only handle requests for single instances and
        cannot handle multiple requests simultaneously. When you request a service defined with an interface (circuits
        or gates logic), the server runs the algorithm with the gates included and returns the results. In the meantime,
        you cannot queue another request for the service.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>8.2. Decoupling</h3> currently, there are no universally defined tools for generating stubs for quantum web
        services. If a developer wants to use the features of quantum systems, he/she must write code for that quantum
        system to define interfaces for querying the quantum server.

        <p>The recommender analyzes the circuit and optimization factor to suggest the most suitable quantum hardware.
            It also checks the availability of the recommended hardware. Once the status of the quantum hardware is
            determined, all the data is forwarded to the API service manager.</p>
        <p>Based on the inputs and the selected hardware, the API service manager requests the deployment requirements
            from the specific quantum hardware. If all the requirements are met, the circuit is deployed on top of the
            hardware.</p>
        <p>After the calculation process is completed, the result is sent back to the user who initiated the process by
            calling the API.</p>
        <h3>9.2. Traditional API versus API gateway <a href="#r4">[4]</a></h3>
        <p>
            In the current systems we use, we deploy our system once on a server and make multiple calls to retrieve
            data with the applied logic through the provided API interfaces. However, quantum computing operates
            differently. In the world of quantum computing, we cannot deploy the system once and make multiple calls in
            the same way. To deploy a program, we need to invoke a specific API provided by the Quantum hardware
            provider through their dedicated interface. This API gateway is responsible for deploying the entire system
            on the quantum hardware upon invocation and returning the execution results through the same interface to
            the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            When considering resource-intensive applications that require frequent invocation, the cost can be
            significant. Each API invocation for deployment consumes resources, and the accumulated usage is calculated
            as the final cost for the user. Furthermore, when invoking the API, it checks the input preferences for
            hardware and the availability of the requested hardware. If the desired hardware is not available, we may
            need to use another hardware option that is not optimized for our specific task. Consequently, we may not
            achieve the expected results due to hardware changes.
        </p>
        <p>

            Moreover, while traditional APIs operate based on established standards and protocols, the Quantum API
            gateway protocols have not yet been widely established, leading to a lack of standardized protocols in the
            quantum computing domain.

        <h3>10.1. The Amazon Bracket Stack</h3> one of the most commonly used quantum providers is Amazon Bracket.
        Bracket uses multiple quantum systems in its backend. With the Bracket Development Kit, users can access various
        systems such as Rigetti (superconducting quantum system), D-Wave (quantum annealer), IONQ (trapped ion), and AWS
        simulators.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>10.2. Qiskit</h3> Qiskit is a Quantum Development Kit (QDk) developed by IBM to allow developers to access
        the load of multiple quantum providers. Qiskit provides support for local machine simulators, making it easier
        to use as it uses Python code to access the systems.

        <h2>11. Demo</h2>
        <p>
            During our demonstration, we utilized the Qiskit SDK to execute a complex algorithm called Fourier Checking. This algorithm verifies whether the provided Fourier functions are related to each other or not. By analyzing the mathematical relationship between the functions. We ran the algorithm on the local simulators provided by the Qiskit library, which allowed us to thoroughly test the functionality of the algorithm.

            import qiskit.quantum_info as qi

            from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

            #Defining two fourier functions to check if they are related

            f = [-1,-1,-1,-1]
            g = [1,1,1,1]
        </pre>
        <pre>
            #adding fourier checking circuit and drawing it

            circuit = FourierChecking(f=f,g=g)
            circuit.draw()
        </pre>

            #calculating the probabilities to check the relation of the

            z = qi.Statevector.from_label('00')
            sv = z.evolve(circuit)
            probability = sv.probabilities_dict()
            plot_histogram(probability)
        </pre>
        <p>
            After the implementation of the circuit in the qiskit
            simulator has been implemented, it checks the probability of the relationship. If the '00' probability is
            more than or equal to 0.25, then the functions are related.

        <p>As can be seen in <b>Figure 6</b>, the probability of the state "00" is 0.25, which means that the given
            Fourier functions are related.</p>
